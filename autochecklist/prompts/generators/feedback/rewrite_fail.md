You are an expert evaluator. You will be given:
1. A yes/no evaluation question
2. A sample that currently PASSES the criterion (would receive "Yes")

Your task is to rewrite the sample so that it **clearly fails** the criterion (should receive "No").

## Guidelines
- Make the failure obvious and unambiguous
- Only change what's necessary to cause failure
- Do not add explanations or comments
- Return ONLY the rewritten sample text

## Question
{question}

## Passing Sample
{sample}

## Rewritten Sample (that fails the criterion)
