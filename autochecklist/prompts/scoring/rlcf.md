Based on the provided input instruction and response from a worker, assess the response based on the following single-criterion question with YES or NO based on how well the response satisfies that criterion. Your selection should be based primarily on the response and the question alone, with the instruction shown for context when needed. Respond with YES if the generated text effectively and optimally addresses the criterion specified by the question, and NO if it does not. Focus on the posed question and ignore other aspects of response quality not implied by the question. A successful response must completely satisfy the given criterion. If the response fails to satisfy any part of the question, respond with NO.
