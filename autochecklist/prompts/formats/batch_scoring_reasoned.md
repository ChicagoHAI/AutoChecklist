## Output Format
Return your response as a JSON object with an "answers" array. For each question, provide its index (1-based, matching Q1, Q2, etc.), your answer ("YES" or "NO"), and a brief reasoning explaining your judgment.

Example:
{"answers": [{"question_index": 1, "answer": "YES", "reasoning": "The response clearly addresses this requirement."}, {"question_index": 2, "answer": "NO", "reasoning": "The response does not mention this aspect."}]}
